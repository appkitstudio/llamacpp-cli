I need help building a React web application. The source code is complete and functional, but I'm experiencing npm installation issues on my development machine that prevent building the production bundle.

# Task

Please build the React application in the `web/` directory and create a production-ready `dist/` folder.

# Steps

1. Navigate to the `web/` directory
2. Run `npm install` (verify that packages actually install - should see 300+ packages, not just 14)
3. Run `npm run build` to create the production bundle
4. Verify the `dist/` directory was created with:
   - `index.html` (~0.5 KB)
   - `assets/` folder with .js and .css files
5. Create a tarball or zip of the `dist/` directory: `tar -czf llamacpp-web-dist.tar.gz dist/`

# Verification

After building, please confirm:
- ✅ Build completed without errors
- ✅ `dist/index.html` exists
- ✅ `dist/assets/` contains JavaScript and CSS files with hash names
- ✅ Total bundle size (check the Vite output)

# Troubleshooting

If `npm install` shows the same issue (packages appear empty):
- Try `yarn install && yarn build` instead
- Or try `pnpm install && pnpm build`

Full instructions are in `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` if you need more details.

# What to Return

Please provide the `dist/` directory (as tarball/zip) so I can deploy it on my machine. The admin server is already configured to serve the built files.
